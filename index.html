His research focuses on the perceptions and use of information and learning technologies in education for collaborative teaching and learning and combining different data sources to arrive at concrete findings for evaluate, assessment, and future work. <br /><br />Steven’s current research examines how learning management systems are used by instructors and students in higher education and how that use impacts pedagogy. This longitudinal research program not only details how current users perceive and interact with the technology, but also informs future design for these ubiquitous systems.
